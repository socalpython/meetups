# September meetup at Headspace

__Speakers__

* **Chris Morales**: "Unit Test Coverage Tool, Your Friendly Neighborhood Illusionist" 

  We all seen that "100% green badge" and celebrated victory. But what does coverage really mean and can you trust it? 

  _Takeaways from this talk:_

  * Different types of provable coverage such as line coverage, statement coverage, branch coverage. 
  * Code bits for which coverage is really hard and how to document it. 
  * Different strategies for unittesting that can produce clear data with documented pit falls.


* **Nathan Lomeli** : "Natural Language Processing: Parsing Through The Hype with Python" 

  We've heard a lot about natural language tools and interfaces over the past several years--Google's Translate, IBM's Watson, Apple's Siri--but what's the true state of the art once we've parsed the fine print and extracted the key ideas? 
 
  _Takeaways from this talk:_

	* Natural language understanding remains a monumental challenge because computers typically lack the situational context and world knowledge necessary to make sense of writing and speech. 
	* Despite the hype about big data driven machine learning techniques, these challenges have not been meaningfully addressed by new technologies. 
	* There are, however, a handful of interesting (and even useful) tasks that NLP technology is currently capable of tackling effectively. 
	* spaCy and NLTK are two Python libraries suitable for meeting common NLP needs.
