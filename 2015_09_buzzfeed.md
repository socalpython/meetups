*Jon Morehouse* (Buzzfeed Software Engineer, Video Infrastructure), on Building Robust Async Python Services w/ Tornado

Description: We'll give a quick run through of what Tornado is and why it's a useful tool for service-oriented architectures. We'll talk about our asynchronous approach, our "small service" philosophy, and how we compose systems to makes it easier for a big team like ours to grasp the different pieces of our architecture.

*Kevin London* (Wiredrive Software Engineer) on potential exploits in Python and the open source [Bandit library](https://github.com/openstack/bandit)
