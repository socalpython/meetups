# August meetup at ChowNow


 __Speakers__

* **Kevin London**: "The Two Trains and Other Refactoring Analogies"

  Now with [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbPrrepO-Bk)!


* **Sep Ehr**: "Harness the power of Python magic methods and lazy objects: Don't forget that With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility."

  In this talk we will use magic methods to create an Application Programmatic Inte/Users/esther/Projects/meetups/2016_09_headspace.mdrface (API) that returns lazy Redis queries, the same way that Django queries are lazy objects.
