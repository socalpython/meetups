At this meetup two PyCon 2016 presenters will preview their talks!

__What Can Software Engineers Learn From The Medical Field__, by Laura Rupprecht

There is a long history of improvements to medical practices, many of which can be applied to software development. This talk will explore some of those practices, and how they can be translated to the world of software.

__Diff it to Dig it__, by Sep Ehr

Do you know about objects `__dict__` and `__slots__` and what they hold? Hashing unhashables? Objects with loops pointing to themselves? Objects that have changed and you want to know how? No? Then this is the talk for you. In this talk we will learn a lot by diffing Python data types and objects, the same way that you can learn a lot about code by git diff. May the diff habit be with you!
