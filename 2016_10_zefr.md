__Speakers__


* __Seth Law__: "Django Unsecured"

  We all love Django, right? Between python and the ability to quickly prototype and develop applications and web services, what’s not to love? Even with these advantages, those pesky security issues are still a problem. Most of the time, it’s only a matter of knowing what to look for so that your application doesn’t have the same issues. This talk will cover common security vulnerabilities seen in Django application and review how to identify, exploit, and fix these vulnerabilities using the open-source intentionally-vulnerable Django.nV (https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV) application.

  Seth Law (@sethlaw) is an experienced Application Security Professional with over 15 years of experience in the computer security industry. During this time, Seth has worked within multiple disciplines in the security field, from software development to network protection, both as a manager and individual contributor. Seth has honed his application security skills using offensive and defensive techniques, including tool development. His understanding of the software development lifecycle allows him to speak as a developer and to equate security issues to development tasks. In his spare time, Seth revels in deep-level analysis of programming frameworks and inherent flaws.


* __Lewis Grimmetti__: "PubSub + Protobuf for Data"

  How can you serve the wildly differing data needs of multiple teams without compromising on code complexity?

  Lewis's talk will be on managing data flow between teams and services with PubSub Architecture and Google's Protocol Buffers.

  Lewis is a Data Engineer on ZEFR's Data Pipeline team!
